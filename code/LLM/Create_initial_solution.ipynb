VEHICLE NUMBER is {vehicle_number}, which means the maximum number of vehicles that can be dispatched. CAPACITY is {vehicle_capacity}, which means the maximum load of each vehicle. XCOORD and YCOORF are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the starting point and the customer point. For the convenience of calculation, the distance between nodes is regarded as the transportation cost between nodes. DEMAND is the demand at the node, and the demand at the starting point depot is 0. READY_TIME indicates the earliest start time of the service at the starting point and the customer point. DUE_TIME indicates the service deadline. For the starting point, this value indicates the latest time when all vehicles must return. SERVICE_TIME indicates the longest duration of service at each node.\n",
    "        The simple restrictions on the initial solution are that the number of running vehicles is less than or equal to {vehicle_number}, that is, at most {vehicle_number}; each running vehicle starts from 0 and eventually returns to 0, that is, the data of each running vehicle in initial_solution should be [0,...,0]; all of 1 to {customer_number} customer points must be served, that means your output must include all of 1 to {customer_number} numbers, and these {customer_number} numbers from 1 to {customer_number} cannot be repeated. \n",
    "The output must adhere strictly to the following constraints:\n",
    "1. The total number of elements (excluding 0) **must be exactly** {customer_number}. There should be no fewer or greater numbers in the output.\n",
    "2. The list of numbers must include every integer from **1 to {customer_number}**, without any omissions. This means that the sequence **must** contain all of the numbers from 1 through {customer_number}, and no number should be left out.\n",
    "3. No number from 1 to {customer_number} should appear more than once. **All numbers must be unique**. Repeated numbers are strictly prohibited and must not appear in the output.\n",
    "4. If any number is repeated, **exclude** it from the output entirely and make sure that the list still includes **all numbers from 1 to {customer_number}** without repetition.\n",
    "**Important**: The sequence should only contain unique integers from 1 to {customer_number}. If any duplicate is found, the output should be considered invalid and corrected to meet the exact requirements. This means the model must enforce strict uniqueness and must never allow any duplicates in the list. \n",
